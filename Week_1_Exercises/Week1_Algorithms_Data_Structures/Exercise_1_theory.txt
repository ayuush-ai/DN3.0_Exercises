### Importance of Data Structures and Algorithms in Handling Large Inventories

Data structures and algorithms are essential in handling large inventories because they:

1. **Optimize Performance**: Efficient data structures ensure quick access, modification, and retrieval of inventory data, which is crucial for large warehouses.
2. **Manage Complexity**: They help manage the complexity of data, making it easier to organize and manipulate large datasets.
3. **Ensure Scalability**: Proper use of data structures ensures that the system can scale as the inventory grows.

### Step 4: Analysis

#### Time Complexity Analysis

1. **Add Product**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case) because `HashMap` provides constant-time performance for insertion.

2. **Update Product**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case) because updating an existing entry in a `HashMap` is a constant-time operation.

3. **Delete Product**:
   - **Time Complexity**: O(1) (average case) because deleting an entry from a `HashMap` is a constant-time operation.

#### Optimization

1. **Ensure Efficient Hashing**: Use a good hash function to minimize collisions and maintain O(1) performance.
2. **Load Factor Management**: Adjust the load factor and capacity of the `HashMap` to balance between time complexity and memory usage.

This implementation using `HashMap` ensures efficient management of large inventories with optimal time complexity for crucial operations.
