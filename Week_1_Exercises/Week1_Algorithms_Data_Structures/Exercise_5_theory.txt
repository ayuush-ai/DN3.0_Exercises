### Step 1: Understand Linked Lists

#### Singly Linked List
- **Description**: A linked list where each node contains a reference to the next node in the sequence. The last node points to null.
- **Advantages**: Simple to implement, efficient for adding and removing elements at the beginning.
- **Disadvantages**: Inefficient for accessing elements by index (O(n) time complexity).

#### Doubly Linked List
- **Description**: A linked list where each node contains references to both the next and the previous nodes.
- **Advantages**: More efficient for operations that require backward traversal or modifications at both ends of the list.
- **Disadvantages**: More complex to implement and requires extra memory for storing the previous node reference.

### Step 4: Analysis

#### Time Complexity of Operations
- **Add**: O(n) in the worst case for a singly linked list as we may need to traverse to the end of the list.
- **Search**: O(n) in the worst case since we may need to traverse the entire list.
- **Traverse**: O(n) since we visit each node once.
- **Delete**: O(n) in the worst case as we may need to find the node before deleting it.

#### Advantages of Linked Lists over Arrays
1. **Dynamic Size**: Linked lists can grow and shrink in size dynamically, unlike arrays which have a fixed size.
2. **Efficient Insertions/Deletions**: Inserting or deleting elements in a linked list is more efficient than in an array, especially for large datasets or when operations occur at the beginning or middle of the list.
3. **Memory Utilization**: Linked lists can utilize memory more efficiently since they don't require contiguous memory allocation like arrays.

Linked lists are particularly useful for scenarios where dynamic data management is required, and the number of elements is not known in advance.
