### Step 1: Understand Sorting Algorithms

#### Bubble Sort
- **Description**: Repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n)
  - **Average Case**: O(n^2)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2)

#### Insertion Sort
- **Description**: Builds the final sorted array one item at a time by repeatedly picking the next item and inserting it into the correct position.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n)
  - **Average Case**: O(n^2)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2)

#### Quick Sort
- **Description**: Divides the array into two smaller sub-arrays (low and high elements) and recursively sorts them. Uses a pivot element for partitioning.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n log n)
  - **Average Case**: O(n log n)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n^2)

#### Merge Sort
- **Description**: Divides the array into two halves, sorts them, and then merges them back together.
- **Time Complexity**:
  - **Best Case**: O(n log n)
  - **Average Case**: O(n log n)
  - **Worst Case**: O(n log n)

### Step 4: Analysis

#### Performance Comparison
- **Bubble Sort**: Inefficient for large datasets due to its O(n^2) time complexity in the average and worst cases.
- **Quick Sort**: Generally preferred due to its O(n log n) time complexity in the best and average cases, making it more suitable for large datasets.

#### Why Quick Sort is Generally Preferred
Quick Sort is generally preferred over Bubble Sort because it is significantly faster on average, especially for large datasets. While the worst-case time complexity of Quick Sort is O(n^2), this can be mitigated with good pivot selection strategies, making it more efficient in practice than Bubble Sort, which consistently has a poor time complexity of O(n^2) in the average and worst cases.
